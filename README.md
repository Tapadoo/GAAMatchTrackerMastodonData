Repository to store mappings from Twitter Handles to Mastodon Handles for GAA Clubs

Tapadoo's GAAMatchTracker App now supports posting to Mastodon.

As part of this, we've put together a simple process when posting to mastodon, to handle the fact that the app was originally designed for posting to twitter.
A json file is used to create mappings from the original Twitter handle to the Mastodon handle, when posting to Mastodon.

The enslosed JSON file contains a list of clubs who are both on Twitter and Mastodon, and the mappings between them.

Pull requests are accepted. If your club is on both Twitter and Mastodon, simply issue a pull reuqest to have it included.
